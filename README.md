# Fiverr UI clone

## Description

-The primary focus of this project was to faithfully recreate a fully responsive Fiverr UI clone using React and Typescript, alongside SCSS modules.

-In this project, I integrated animations and transitions to enhance the user interface's visual appeal and interactivity. Additionally, I designed key pages such as the homepage, service listings, detailed service page, pages for services offered and purchased, a messaging interface, and a dedicated page for managing all messages.

-Additionally, I implemented routing functionality to facilitate seamless navigation between different pages.
